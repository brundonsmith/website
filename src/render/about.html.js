                    <p>
                        As a programmer I'm 
                        <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equal parts type 1 and type 3</a>.
                        Professionally I'm a web developer; at home I dabble in mostly game and 
                        <a href="https://github.com/brundonsmith/raytracer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graphics programming</a>.

                        This is my semi-professional blog for thoughts on programming, but also on life and whatever 
                        else. It's also a chance to do things I don't get to do so much at work like lean on HTML itself instead 
                        of JavaScript components, and run my own totally custom web server. I may also host some projects on here
                        some day.
