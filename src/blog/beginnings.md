title: New Website

I decided to rebuild my website from scratch.

For a few years now at my day job I've been working mostly on high-complexity, company-internal JavaScript web apps. I've really enjoyed that, but this felt like a good opportunity to do the complete opposite in a number of ways:

- Server-side rendering instead of client-side rendering
- Pure JS/CSS with no build steps
- Semantic HTML instead of `<div>`-soup
- High accessibility/compatibility instead of something that never has to face the public internet

Chrome seems to think I'm doing a good job so far!

And now I have an easily-extensible blog that I can post to just by adding a markdown file to the repository. That's pretty exciting. Let's write some stuff!
