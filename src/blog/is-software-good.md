title: "Does computing make the world better?"

I was reading an article the other day about some recent headway being made in type 
theory. It was exciting stuff; stuff that may one day make systems faster, more reliable,
more expressive. It felt very important in a vague way. But it also got me 
thinking: is this really going to make the world a better place than it was 
before?

Last week I was talking with my sister about how people in our society have 
gotten so toxic and tribal over the past decade, and how it's breaking America's 
ability to have civil discourse. I said, half-jokingly, "Really I think it's 
computers' fault". Of course by "computers" I really meant "social-media", but 
maybe part of me didn't 
(I'm not sure we could have cheap, powerful, networked computers without 
something like modern social-media emerging eventually).

There are plenty of examples where computers have made people's 
lives better in some way. The availability of educational information through resources 
like Wikipedia, the ability to navigate in unfamiliar areas, the ability to stay in touch 
with loved ones more easily. Even industrial uses like spreadsheets, control systems, and CAD 
software arguably make real peoples' lives better somewhere down the road. 
Personally I think the artistic possibilities opened up by computers are 
wonderful.

But many of these have been around, in more or less the same form, for years. 
And since then we've seen the rise of unprecedented surveillance, the democratization 
of [autonomous weapons](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/34204/turkey-now-has-a-swarming-quadcopter-suicide-drone-that-it-could-export) and
[disinformation](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/12/how-i-created-a-deepfake-of-mark-zuckerberg-and-star-treks-data/),
and economic inequality being amplified by the concentration 
of power in the hands that can buy it. Areas like these seem to be where the most 
"progress" is being made today, and if I'm being honest, 
it feels like we've passed a threshold where - broadly defined - "progress in 
computing" may have become decoupled from "betterment of humanity".

To engineers, the process of improvement is like catnip. We salivate at the 
opportunity to make something - anything - *objectively better* in just about 
any way. What purpose it actually serves down the line can often take a 
back-seat. Sometimes we choose to ignore the consequences of what we build; 
other times we invent things that don't need to be invented just so that we have 
something to work on. In either case we're strongly biased to convince ourselves 
that all the improvements we're making eventually translate to improvements in 
the *world* in some small way. That what we're doing is intrinsically a 
noble pursuit.

I don't know. I've become skeptical. The idea of having fun and doing good at 
the same time is incredibly seductive. But I just don't think those two things 
perfectly align very often - in any field, really, but especially in computing 
in 2020.

So what to do? I don't really know. Personally I've taken to focusing on first 
doing no harm. In my personal opinion, lots of software jobs right now do some amount of 
harm to some amount of people, and I don't want to take part in that even through one 
or two steps of indirection. Luckily it isn't too hard to find a company 
that's (roughly) a net neutral for society.

I also allow myself to continue taking joy in the process, even
if it isn't important by some grander definition of important. It's okay to 
invent useless things, create beautiful projects for
their own sake, etc. Understanding that they probably won't lend themselves to a 
higher purpose doesn't have to ruin the enjoyment
I get from the process itself. In fact, it helps me better-prioritize how I 
spend my time and energy, and it can even be freeing in a way: a project doesn't
have to be useful to be worth doing.

Hopefully this doesn't come across as too negative. I could be wrong about all 
this, and I therefore tried to keep this post in the "expression of subjective thoughts" 
territory instead of letting it become prescriptive in any way. I also still love 
what I do; I've just lost some of the sunny optimism I used to have about it.
But that feels, in some way, healthy.
